# How to contribute to the Coveo CLI

## I found a bug, what should I do?

- **Do not open up a GitHub Issue if the bug is a security vulnerability
  in Coveo or the Coveo CLI**, and instead refer to our [Vulnerability Management documentation](https://docs.coveo.com/en/2024/security/vulnerability-management).

- **Do not open up a GitHub Issue if the issue is not related to the Coveo CLI**, and instead contact our support through [Coveo Connect](https://connect.coveo.com/s/contactsupport).

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/cli/issues).

- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/coveo/cli/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

- If possible, use the relevant issue report templates to create the issue.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

- Test your changes locally. Refer to the [Local Setup to Contribute](https://github.com/coveo/cli#local-setup-to-contribute) for instructions on how to setup locally and test your changes.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

- Suggest your change in the [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/coveo/cli/discussions/categories/ideas) and start writing code.

- Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

- Ask any question about how to use the Coveo-CLI in the [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/coveo/cli/discussions/categories/q-a)
- Ask any question about how to use the Coveo in general at [Coveo Connect](https://connect.coveo.com)

Thanks for your contributions!
