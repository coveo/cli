## What is it?

The Coveo CLI is a powerful command-line interface (CLI) that interacts with the Coveo platform to facilitate development and build automation.
Key features include the following:

- Quickly create a [Coveo Headless](https://docs.coveo.com/headless)-powered search page for your Coveo organization, relying on popular frameworks like [Angular](https://angular.io), [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).
- Create and manage Coveo [organizations](https://docs.coveo.com/en/2015)
- Automate deployments between organizations
- Manage Coveo [Push API](https://docs.coveo.com/en/68) sources
- Perform [queries](https://docs.coveo.com/en/l25h0358) against a Coveo index
