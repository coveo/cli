run SetUserFTA.exe in the user context with following command line parameters:

SetUserFTA.exe extension progid optional:groupname

or

SetUserFTA.exe configfile

"SetUserFTA.exe del .txt" will remove the UserChoice key from the .txt handler
"SetUserFTA.exe get" will list all User FTA's (just like GetUserFTA)

EXAMPLE:
========

SetUserFTA.exe .txt txtfile

or to use group checking:

SetUserFTA.exe .txt txtfile "Notepad Users"

Note: you can supply the group including the domain like "Domain\group" or even in UPN format. 
if the group contains a space, you must use quotes (not when using a config file).

SetUserFTA.exe path_to_config_file

a config file contains multiple associations - one per line, values separated by comma.

Example: .vsdx, VisioViewer.Viewer, Visio Users

the group is optional and must not contain quotes.
